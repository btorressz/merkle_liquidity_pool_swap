# merkle_liquidity_pool_swap


This project implements a Merkle Tree-based Liquidity Pool on the Solana blockchain. It allows efficient management of liquidity provider (LP) shares using a Merkle tree, reducing on-chain storage costs by maintaining LP data off-chain. LPs can verify their contributions with Merkle proofs to claim their share or swap tokens in the pool.

## Features

- **Efficient LP Management**: Represent LPs off-chain using a Merkle tree for minimized storage costs.
- **Gas-Efficient Swaps**: Only the Merkle root is stored on-chain, while LP contributions are verified via Merkle proofs.
- **Flexible LP Withdrawals**: LPs can partially withdraw or use emergency withdrawals with a penalty.
- **Governance and Rebalancing**: LPs can vote to adjust pool parameters or rebalance based on external price feeds.
